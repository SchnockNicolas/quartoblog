You may recognize them by they “HTTP Only” parameter the cookie list. They transport server variables, and are more secured : they can not be read by general trackers. They generally manage authentification and loging process.\nJavascript cookies, are written by scripts added on the website. Often “third party” scripts, meaning partners of the website you visit. They are less secured. In fact, you can write a cookie on my website. In the developper tool, go to console and write document.cookie = \"username=John Doe\"; You’ll see a new cookie there (yes, on lykta.be!).\n\n\nAnother distinction is interesting : - First party cookies : cookies written by a script on the domain you visit. - Third party cookies: cookies written by a script on another domain. Most trackers are on that category.\nYou can visualise third party cookies via Firefox (former Lightbeam add on). You’ll realise most site you visit share the same trackers, and collect interesting data about you.\nBy abuse of language, we can also consider as cookies storage space in the browser:\n\nLocal storage\nSession storage\nIndexed Data base The objective is still the same : cache data to avoid asking always the same things to humain or servers.\n\nSome people call “cookies” the scripts you put on the website to track users (trackers). It is wrong, all javascript script don’t write cookies (they can send information to another server and store). But in marketing, it’s common to understand cookie, with trackers in extension, they will be included in the “cookie process” such as listing, consent request, storage and management.\n\n\nFirst problem with cookies : data privacy\nThe initial usage of cookies is acceptable : convenience. You don’t have to choose your language over and over again. Fine.\nBut with the tracking busines, cookies keep a track of what you visit. By accumulation, the tracking providers collect a lot of information about you. What you read, when, how much time. In some cases what you write, ..

Their performance and ROI are purefly forgotten.\nIn a phygital world, where online and offline are constantly mixing, a media performance evaluation SHOULD include those media. The barrier online/offline is not obvious for consumer, it should be taken into account by marketeers.\nMoreover, the digital attribution justifies the online/offline barrier within organisations and industry. There is a digital marketeer, talking to a digital agency, buying space to digital publishers. Which makes less and less sense and heratic for any consumer driven marketing.\n\nTo illustrate : think about adressable TV. Is it an offline or online medium ? The consumer isn’t even aware a “standard” TV commercial can be bought on an online process, on online-like audiences with online KPI’s but showed on a linear ad break. And yet, it’s the case. Same exists for DOOH, radio,…"

But they must be taken into account.\n\nSome media are tracked at the impression level : for display or programmatic, there are things call impression tracker, which write a cookie each time an ad is displayed on the screen (seen or not), then this will be counted in the digital attribution.\nSome media does not have those “impression trackers” (or are complicated/expensive). The workaround is creating a “click tracker” : a page between the click and the landing page, where a cookie will be written only when the ad is clicked. Social networks often fall under that category.\nSome players are not tracked, such as Amazon Ads. If you have a product on your website and on Amazon, you can’t see cross overs : the impact of facebook ads on sales on Amazon.\n\nThe attribution will show a table, with leads attributed to impressions for display, to clicks for social networks, and not mentionning other walled gardens.

Calling for gtag.js on a google server does not allow that governance.\nThere is no legal protection. Or any service level agreement. If the tracker crashed the site or leak data, without any contract, there is no legal remediation possible.\n\n\n\nI personnally made the experience : the adtech provider didn’t renew its SSL certificate on a dependency of the tracker : the whole website of my employer was defined as “not secured” by every browsers, with a “your connection is not private” message. Without a balanced SLA, the provider is not obliged to fix the problem within an acceptable timeframe (“acceptable” can differ from industries), and the loss is for the advertiser"

How ?\n\nWhat is the CNAME hack\nTo avoid ATP/ETP problems, Boursorama wanted to consider third party trackers like first party. It’s possible to do via their URL : putting a “CNAME” in the DNS (a link from boursorama to trackers’s domain). It’s like saying browsers “Google is a part of Boursorama, trust everything coming from Google like a Boursorama asset”. (The responsible who decided to apply this hack didn’t fully understand IT security or didn’t have trust issues).\nSafari, Firefox and adblockers consider the trackers behind boursorama.fr as first party, and therefore allow them.\n\n\nConsequences\nThat means the adtech provider is considered as first party, and therefore has access to all first party cookies from Boursorama. Those first party cookies may include security informations like usernames, security tokens and other identifiers (this is the process that allows you to stay connected between two pages). In that case, those information were sent (leaked) to Smart Adserver, AT Internet and other adtech providers. People that have access to those information in Smart Adserver could log in to banking account of Boursorama\nIf the temptation to consider “third party” trackers as first party is high (resolving the problem of adblocking and ITP/ETP), it has severe consequences on security."
