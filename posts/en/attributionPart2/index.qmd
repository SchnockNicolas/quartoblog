# Adblocking by your local network

If you're on a big company, odds are some websites won't be accessible. There is a "black list" of websites you can not access. Mostly for security reasons.
Such system is call **DNS sinkhole**. You can install it at on your network for free. There are good sinkholes open source, my favorite is Pihole. https://pi-hole.net

On my network, it blocks around 30% of requests done by my computer, smartphones and other connected devices : mostly telemetry and tracking. I loaded a list of around a millions URL which I request to block. 
I have a complete control on what I white & black list with complete statistics.

This technology prevents tracker script from loading on my computers/smartphones, plus it blocks HTTP requests to blacked list servers.

As said, many businesses use those blocking on their website, for IT security reasons. Which makes complicated tracking for a significative part of traffic during the day.


# Initiated by your device : adbockers

Many add ons, apps, propose to block adds on your device. Adblock, purify,.. You're only one search away from the adblock of your dream.
They are common, and have direct impact on digital attribution : those leads are purely invisibile.
