In part 1, we saw privacy legislation prevented attribution to be correct, and brought a biais that can be as high as 65%. Here we deal with another biais.

# Adblocking by the browser

As privacy became an important topic, it became a "USP" for several browsers. Most known example of Safari and Firefox.

They block 3rd party cookies, with different levels and different techniques.




The combined usage of both in around 30% in France (21.52% + 7.94%). 40% in mobile.

## Adblocking makes at least 30% of consumers invisible. 40% in mobile
This is the combined market share of Safari & Firefox in France
:::

## Apps are also restricted

Apple applied the App transparency framework. If the user opted out (or didn't opt in). It blocks the access of a "device ID" to trackers. The link between the ad and the sale can not be done properly.



# Adblocking by your local network

If you're on a big company, odds are some websites won't be accessible. There is a "black list" of websites you can not access. Mostly for security reasons.
Such system is call **DNS sinkhole**. You can install it at on your network for free. There are good sinkholes open source, my favorite is Pihole. https://pi-hole.net

On my network, it blocks around 30% of requests done by my computer, smartphones and other connected devices : mostly telemetry and tracking. I loaded a list of around a millions URL which I request to block. 
I have a complete control on what I white & black list with complete statistics.

This technology prevents tracker script from loading on my computers/smartphones, plus it blocks HTTP requests to blacked list servers.

As said, many businesses use those blocking on their website, for IT security reasons. Which makes complicated tracking for a significative part of traffic during the day.


# Initiated by your device : adbockers

Many add ons, apps, propose to block adds on your device. Adblock, purify,.. You're only one search away from the adblock of your dream.
They are common, and have direct impact on digital attribution : those leads are purely invisibile.

## Adblocks

According to GWI, 37% of mobile users are using an adblocker. 39% for Chrome users in Europe.

# Make the count

-> Around 30% of people are not measurable (the effect on mobile is even higher)
-> On the rest, around of 30% uses adblocker

Not measurable people are a significant part of Internet traffic. Again, type of browser bring an important biais on results.
