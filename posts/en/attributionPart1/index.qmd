Cookie based attribution is crooked in 2022. In this series, we'll explain 5 reasons why we need to work on an other measurement framework :

1) **Data Privacy**
2) Validity of data after adblocking (ITP/ETP/ATT included)
3) Security : IT & legal at risk
4) A consumer perspective
5) GAFA & media agencies are judges and parties


# Introduction 

Digital attribution is the process by which advertisers see advertising investment drives growth and which does not. This process hasn't change for about 15 years. But most digital marketing decions are based on this outdated tool. 

Privacy issue is not ethic, but questions the validity of attribution's results. Particularly since 2018, digital reports are importantly biased.

# What are cookies ?

Cookies are small text files stored on your browser. They are used to store data about you, the most often an identifier. It allows the server to recognise you (your browser) each time you connect.

They are used for authentication, convenience, remember parameters you already gave (like language preference). And.. Track users.

You can see them in the menu of your favorite browser, "more tools" - developper tools - application - cookies.

# Different types of cookie

There are two main types : HTTP cookies and Javascript cookies. 

- **HTTP Cookies** are written during the loading of the page, they are defined in headers of the page you receive. You may recognize them by they "HTTP Only" parameter the cookie list. They transport server variables, and are more secured : they can not be read by general trackers. They generally manage authentification and loging process. 
- **Javascript cookies**, are written by scripts added on the website. Often "third party" scripts, meaning partners of the website you visit. They are less secured. In fact, you can write a cookie on my website. In the developper tool, go to console and write `document.cookie = "username=John Doe";` You'll see a new cookie there (yes, on lykta.be!).

Another distinction is interesting :

- **First party cookies** : cookies written by a script on the domain you visit. 
- **Third party cookies**: cookies written by a script on another domain. Most trackers are on that category.

The distinction is important for data security : a tracker from domain X has access only to its own cookies and can not read the data written by other parties. Breaking this security design can have severe consequences.

You can visualise third party cookies via Firefox (former **Lightbeam** add on). You'll realise most site you visit share the same trackers, and collect interesting data about you.

# Corrolary of cookies : trackers (JS)

By abuse of language, we can also consider as cookies storage space in the browser:

- Local storage
- Session storage
- Indexed Data base

The objective is  the same : cache data to avoid asking always the same things to humain or servers. 

Some people call "cookies" the scripts you put on the website to track users (trackers). It is wrong, all javascript scripts don't write cookies (they can send information to another server and store remotely). But in marketing, it's common to understand cookie, with trackers in extension, they will be included in the "cookie process" such as listing, consent request, storage and management.

Cookies aren't harmful for privacy. But scripts that write them are more problematic. 

# Aggregation of trackers and impact on data privacy

The initial usage of cookies is acceptable : convenience. You don't have to choose your language over and over again. Fine.

But for adtech purposed, cookies keep a track of what you visit. By accumulation, the tracking providers collect a lot of information about you. What you read, when, how much time. It can evne capture what you write. The javascript can controll your browser (that's the purpose of the langage). There are only few limits on tracking within a given website.

But the same trackers are present on millions on website. And that's where privacy is mostly impacted. If a website knows you visit a page, it's not a big deal. But if a tracker knows you visited successively a medical forum, then on a contact medical center page, they can deduct your sick and what are your symptoms. They share that information with millions of potential advertisers (and their dozens of middle men) to sell ads at the higher cost. At that point, the privacy border is crossed for a long time.

Most sites share the same trackers, and identifiers. And therefore, your profile can be calculated by the accumulation of websites you visit. From adtech point of view, your browsing history can be represented as a graph.


## Leglislator response to privacy problem

 Not a very long time ago, you could target one person for an ad. It even became a paradigm in communication plans, under the concept of "relevancy" : brand wanted to engage consumer in a personalized 1 to 1 communication.

But the industry went too far in this profiling. European legislator tried to regulate, with different tries :

- 2009/136/CE : cookies were tolerated but user must receive clear and complete information (via pop ups)
- GPDR : user consent is required for trackers. Despite the regulation don't aim cookies, the word "cookie" is quoted only once for example purpose.
- E-privacy directive reiterates the need for consent for cookies (and to write any information on user's device). In opposite to GDPR, it applies whether cookies contains personal data or not. 

# Consent & opt in : implications on marketing

Since 2018, a consent is required to track users. “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous”.  Benchmarks are not clear about the opt in rate. It's also optimisable : structured companies constantly review their consent process to increase consents. 
From my experience, 75% seems reasonable (which is also what [https://www.commandersact.com/en/privacy-barometer-2019/](studies) say). But it's variable and depends on the public and the industry. The [https://iapp.org/news/a/yes-how-opt-in-consent-really-works/](IAPP) - a website for privacy professionnals - states 34% cookies opt in.

## Consent brings an important biais in cookie attribution.

Consent hides from 10 to 75% of your soft or hard leads, depending on industry and public. It bias results, erasing the personna "privacy pudic" from your marketing actions.

:::

Presence of a significant (variable and difficult manageable) discrepancy is a problem for digital attribution, and question by itself its validity to  estimate media performance without any complementary studies.

This is only a fraction of attribution's bias. Adblocking and browser's privacy protection (ATP/ETP/ATT) make it worst. Check for part II.
