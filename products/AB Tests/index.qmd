AB Tests are powerful tools to analyse the effectiness of a media plan. But it must follow defined steps to reach their goal. 

# What are geo AB tests

Well define a control group (= 1 or several geographical zones) and an exposed group. The control group won't see the ad. The exposed group will.

We'll analyse results of both zones and see if the advertising has an impact on sales (or revenue).

# Several steps

If the process seems quite easy, we must take precautions

## Design control & exposed groups.

We'll design groups that look like each other. The temptation to take two different markets is high. But it can bias the analysis : if a external events occurs in one market and not on the other one, you can start all the process over again.
Therefore we make sure both groups are comparable and homogeneus, to ensure we won't have biaises in the results.

## Power of analysis

We design a test plan, which contains
- Length of test : few days? few weeks ? few months
- Strengh of desired effects:  if you are looking a +100% effects on sales, the test will be pretty short, you'll know quickly if you can double your sales with a markting action. But if the effect is less obvious, you'll need a long period and a long exposition to be sure it's due to your marketing strategy.
- budget needed : based on impressions and CPM, we'll deduct the minimal investment needed.


## Modelisation of both groups

We'll forecast data of both groups, first check the model is correct on the control, and secondly if real sales are increasing on the exposed.


## Compute the increment

When the test is over, we check results and deduct the incremental value of your marketing actions. It's time now to enlarge the actions on bigger scale.

## Bonus : calibration of the Marketing Mix Model

The insights found during a geo AB test can be used to calibrate MArketing Mix Model. It is a process that increases accuracy of the MMM, making both analysis very complementary.
